# Discord-DateTime

A very simple static page to help convert a date-time to the corresponding discord string.

I expect discord will implement the full feature within the app in the future.

## Reference

Use <t:TIMESTAMP:FLAG> to send it

Available flags:

    t: Short time (e.g 9:41 PM)
    T: Long Time (e.g. 9:41:30 PM)
    d: Short Date (e.g. 30/06/2021)
    D: Long Date (e.g. 30 June 2021)
    f (default): Short Date/Time (e.g. 30 June 2021 9:41 PM)
    F: Long Date/Time (e.g. Wednesday, June, 30, 2021 9:41 PM)
    R: Relative Time (e.g. 2 months ago, in an hour)
